/*Cpp program to implement two stack in a array*/

/* Two stack is implemented here by an array.
	One Stack start from the leftmost position of the array and yhe other Stack
	starts from the rightmost position of the array.
	The first element of stack1 pused at index = 0 and the first element of stack2
	pushed at index = n-1.
	This method utilizes all the space in the array.It doesn't cause an overflow
	if any space is available in the array. */
